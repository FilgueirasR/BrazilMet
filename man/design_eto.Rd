\title{Design reference evapotranspiration (Design ET₀)}
\usage{
design_eto(eto_daily_data, percentile = 0.8, grouping = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{eto_daily_data}{A data frame containing daily reference evapotranspiration values (mm day-1) named as "eto", and other column with dates named "date". To estimate the design reference evapotranspiration, it is recommended to use more than 10 years of historical data.}

\item{percentile}{The relative position of a value within the data distribution. The recomendation to desing irrigating is greater than 80 percent (0.8). For instance: The 90th (0.90) percentile of reference evapotranspiration (ET₀) represents a value that is surpassed in only 10 percent of the observed period.}

\item{grouping}{specifies the column used to group the data, typically by station. Use this parameter to calculate the design ET₀ separately for each station, based on the corresponding station code.}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric object with the desing ETo for the respective data and percentile.
}
\description{
Function to calculate the reference evapotranspitation for irrigation design.

\examples{
\dontrun{
design_eto_value <- design_eto(eto, percentile)
